# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive role-based access control system implemented to ensure complete separation between users and recruiters in the Global Connect platform.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Backend Security

#### Authentication Middleware (`/middleware/auth.js`)
- **Role Verification**: JWT tokens include role information ('user' or 'recruiter')
- **Cross-Collection Validation**: Middleware checks both User and Recruiter collections
- **Authorization Function**: `authorize()` function prevents role-based access violations

#### Route Protection
- **User Routes** (`/routes/userAuthRoutes.js`, `/routes/userRoutes.js`):
  - Protected with `authenticate` + `authorize('user')`
  - Only users can access user-specific endpoints
  
- **Recruiter Routes** (`/routes/recruiterAuthRoutes.js`, `/routes/recruiterRoutes.js`):
  - Protected with `authenticate` + `authorize('recruiter')`
  - Only recruiters can access recruiter-specific endpoints

#### Controller-Level Security
- **Double Role Checking**: Controllers perform additional role validation
- **Cross-Collection Email Uniqueness**: Registration prevents same email across user types
- **Explicit Role Verification**: Each protected endpoint verifies user role

### 2. Frontend Security

#### Route Protection (`/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx`)
- **Role-Based Redirects**: Users redirected to appropriate dashboards based on role
- **Session Validation**: Checks for valid user sessions
- **Access Denial Logging**: Logs unauthorized access attempts

#### Context-Level Security (`/context/AuthContext.jsx`)
- **Role Validation**: Validates user roles during login
- **Session Integrity**: Ensures only valid roles are accepted
- **Invalid Session Cleanup**: Removes corrupted session data

#### API Layer Security (`/services/api.js`)
- **Separate API Instances**: Public vs. authenticated API calls
- **Automatic Token Management**: Handles authentication tokens
- **Error Handling**: Redirects on unauthorized access (401 errors)

### 3. Registration Security

#### Email Uniqueness Enforcement
- **Cross-Collection Checks**: Registration checks both User and Recruiter collections
- **Prevents Dual Accounts**: One email = one account type only
- **Early Validation**: Checks performed before account creation

#### Role-Specific Registration
- **Separate Endpoints**: `/auth/user/register` vs `/auth/recruiter/register`
- **Role-Specific Data**: Different required fields per role
- **Validation Rules**: Custom validation per user type

### 4. Frontend Access Control

#### Authentication Redirects
- **Already Authenticated**: Redirects to dashboard if trying to register/login while logged in
- **Role-Based Dashboards**: Automatic routing to appropriate dashboard
- **Unauthorized Access**: Prevents cross-role page access

#### Utility Functions (`/utils/roleUtils.js`)
- **Role Constants**: Centralized role definitions
- **Access Validation**: Helper functions for role checking
- **Session Validation**: Comprehensive session integrity checks

## API Endpoints and Access Control

### Public Endpoints (No Authentication Required)
- `POST /api/auth/user/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/user/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/recruiter/register` - Recruiter registration  
- `POST /api/auth/recruiter/login` - Recruiter login

### User-Only Endpoints
- `GET /api/auth/user/me` - Get user profile
- `PUT /api/users/profile` - Update user profile
- `POST /api/users/apply` - Apply for jobs
- `GET /api/users/applications` - Get user applications
- All routes under `/api/users/*`

### Recruiter-Only Endpoints
- `GET /api/auth/recruiter/me` - Get recruiter profile
- `PUT /api/recruiters/profile` - Update company profile
- `POST /api/recruiters/jobs` - Post jobs
- `GET /api/recruiters/applications` - View applications
- All routes under `/api/recruiters/*`

## Frontend Route Protection

### Public Routes
- `/` - Home page
- `/auth` - Authentication selection
- `/user/login` - User login
- `/user/signup` - User signup
- `/recruiter/login` - Recruiter login
- `/recruiter/signup` - Recruiter signup

### User-Only Routes
- `/user-dashboard` - User dashboard
- `/dashboard` (redirects to appropriate dashboard based on role)

### Recruiter-Only Routes
- `/recruiter-dashboard` - Recruiter dashboard
- `/dashboard` (redirects to appropriate dashboard based on role)

## Error Handling and Security Responses

### HTTP Status Codes
- `401 Unauthorized` - Invalid/expired token, not authenticated
- `403 Forbidden` - Valid token but wrong role for endpoint
- `400 Bad Request` - Email already exists, validation errors

### Frontend Error Handling
- Automatic logout on 401 errors
- Redirect to auth page on invalid sessions
- Console warnings for unauthorized access attempts
- User-friendly error messages

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only access what they need
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security checks
3. **Fail Secure**: Default to denying access when in doubt
4. **Session Validation**: Regular checks for session integrity
5. **Audit Logging**: Console logging of security events
6. **Input Validation**: Role and data validation at multiple points
7. **Secure Defaults**: Unauthorized access defaults to denial

## Testing Access Control

### Valid Scenarios
✅ User can access user endpoints with user token
✅ Recruiter can access recruiter endpoints with recruiter token
✅ Public endpoints accessible without authentication
✅ Appropriate redirects based on user role

### Blocked Scenarios
❌ User cannot access recruiter endpoints
❌ Recruiter cannot access user endpoints
❌ Invalid tokens rejected
❌ Expired tokens cause logout
❌ Same email cannot register for both roles
❌ Role tampering in local storage detected and cleared

This comprehensive RBAC system ensures complete separation between user and recruiter access while maintaining a secure and user-friendly experience.
